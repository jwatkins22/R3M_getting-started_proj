Description: Entries from the National Database of Childcare Prices.

The National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) is the most comprehensive federal source of childcare prices at the county level. The database offers childcare price data by childcare provider type, age of children, and county characteristics. Data are available from 2008 to 2018.



The childcare_infant data set is meant for beginner use and only contains a few
variables that have been renamed for clarity:


childcare_infant fields:


study_year - Year the data collection began for the market rate survey and in which ACS data is representative of, or the study publication date.

poverty_families - Poverty rate for families.

poverty_individuals - Poverty rate for individuals.

median_income_2018 - 	Median household income expressed in 2018 dollars.

total_population - Count of the total population in the county during study year.

median_center_infant - Aggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Center-based Care for infants (i.e. aged 0 through 23 months). A child care center is a facility outside a private home and is more likely to split childred up by age groups. Centers usually have a larger total group of children than family care.

median_family_infant - Aggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Family Childcare for infants (i.e. aged 0 through 23 months). Family childcare is provided in a person's private home and are more likely to have mixed ages in one group of children. Family childcare usually has a smaller overall group of children.
